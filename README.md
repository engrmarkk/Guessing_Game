<h1>Python Guessing Game</h1>

<p>This is one of the simple python projects yet an exciting one. You
can even call it a mini-game. This project is about making a program in which the
computer randomly chooses a number between 1 to 10, 1 to 100, or
any range. Then give users a hint to guess the number. Every time
the user guesses wrong, he gets another clue, and his score gets
reduced. The clue can be multiples, divisible, greater or smaller, or a
combination of all.</p>
